# Introduction

This was a live demo used for my conference talk [Node.js mini projects](https://umaar.github.io/node-mini-projects-talk/index.html#/). This repo includes a bitbar plugin which invokes the `ScotlandJS.8s.js` script every 8 seconds. The plugin displays Scotland JS related tweets in the Mac menu bar.

# To run

```sh
npm i
npm start
```

Or view the bitbar documentation to install this as a bitbar plugin.
